<hr />
<p>
    Hey folks! wanted to tell you something about me. I have always been inclined towards
    what is called as the techy world in which I like to learn and explore various new things.
    And this interest is not just because I come from a background of engineers but a part of
    it is because I am a kind of lazy boy which boils down to me finding ways to hide my lazyness
    through my or some of the other discoveries.</p>
<p>
    I did my schooling from Little Flower School situated at a place where I was born and brougt
    up- a small discrit of Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh. While the making of this website I am
    persuing my engineering from IIIT Bhagalpur in Bihar.
